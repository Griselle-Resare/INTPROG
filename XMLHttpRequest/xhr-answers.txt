Task 3: Answer the Guide Questions

1. What is the difference between readyState and status in XMLHttpRequest?
->The readyState property shows the status of an XMLHttpRequest, such as whether it has been sent, is loading, or complete.
-> The status property shows the HTTP response code from the server, which tells whether the request was successful (200) or if there was an error (404).

2. How can you make the request asynchronous?
->By adding the true in xhr.open(), which allows the browser to continue working while the data is being loaded.

3. Why is asynchronous communication recommended for web applications?
            -> Because it allows the browser to continue working and responding to the user while data is being requested from the server.
